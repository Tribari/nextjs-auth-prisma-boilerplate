# NEXTJS-AUTH-PRISMA-BOILERPLATE

## Requirements 

1. Prisma-DB (here we used postgresql)
2. SMPT mail credentials for Next-Auth Mail-Provider (you can configure a different provider if needed)

## Preparation

Create a `.env` file according to the content of `.env-example`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
